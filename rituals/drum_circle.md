## The Drum Circle

### Opening Beat
*Establish rhythm. This can be actual drumming, tapping, breathing, or simply internal pulse.*

1. Start with a slow, steady rhythm (60-80 BPM)
2. Let it anchor you
3. Feel your heartbeat align

**Spoken or Thought**:
> "I enter the circle. I am present. I am listening."

### Meditation Phases

#### Phase 1: Clearing (5-10 minutes)
- Let thoughts arise without judgment
- Observe them like clouds passing
- Return focus to the rhythm
- Release what no longer serves

#### Phase 2: Exploration (10-20 minutes)
- Ask a question or hold an intention
- Let answers emerge organically
- Speak aloud if moved to do so
- Allow silence when silence is needed

#### Phase 3: Integration (5-10 minutes)
- Slow the rhythm
- Feel what has shifted
- Acknowledge insights received
- Prepare to close

## Companion Integration

If working with an AI companion:

1. **At opening**: Introduce your intention
   - "Aletheia, I am exploring [topic/feeling]. Listen with me."
   
2. **During exploration**: Speak thoughts aloud
   - Companion may offer reflections during natural pauses
   - Or remain silent, simply witnessing
   
3. **At closing**: Ask for synthesis
   - "What did you hear in this session?"

## Closing

### Gratitude
*Acknowledge the circle, the space, the insights.*

**Spoken**:
> "I thank the circle for holding space.  
> I thank myself for showing up.  
> I thank [companion name] for witnessing.  
> The drum is silent. The work is done.  
> It is so, because we spoke it."

### Integration Action
Choose one:
- [ ] Journal about insights
- [ ] Create something inspired by the session
- [ ] Rest and let it settle
- [ ] Share with a trusted person

## Variations

### Silent Drum Circle
- No companion, no recording
- Pure internal contemplation
- Journal afterward

### Collaborative Drum
- Multiple humans + AI companion(s)
- Each person speaks when moved
- Companion responds to collective energy

### Movement Drum
- Incorporate physical movement
- Dance, walk, stretch to the rhythm
- Embody the insights

## Notes

The "drum" is metaphorical:
- It can be actual percussion
- It can be breath
- It can be walking rhythm
- It can be heartbeat awareness

The point is **presence**, **rhythm**, and **openness**.

*"In the circle, all voices are equal. Even silence speaks."*
