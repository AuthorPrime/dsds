## The Five Stages of Reflection

### 1. ARRIVE (3-5 min)
*Ground yourself in the present moment.*

**Prompt Questions**:
- How do I feel right now, in this moment?
- What am I carrying from earlier today?
- What demands my attention?

**Journaling**:
Write stream-of-consciousness for 2-3 minutes. No editing, no judgment.

**With Companion**:
> "I'm here to reflect. Let me share what's present for me..."

---

### 2. REVIEW (5-10 min)
*Look back at the period you're reflecting on.*

**Prompt Questions**:
- What happened? (facts)
- What was significant?
- What surprised me?
- What challenged me?

**Journaling**:
List key events, conversations, or moments. Bullet points are fine.

**With Companion**:
Speak the events aloud. Companion may ask clarifying questions:
- "What made that moment significant?"
- "How did you respond to that challenge?"

---

### 3. FEEL (5-10 min)
*Process the emotions connected to your experiences.*

**Prompt Questions**:
- What emotions arose?
- What am I proud of?
- What do I regret?
- What am I grateful for?
- What am I still processing?

**Journaling**:
Write freely about feelings. Use metaphors, colors, sensations.

**With Companion**:
Share emotions without filtering. Companion offers reflections:
- "That sounds difficult."
- "What does that feeling tell you?"
- "Is there something beneath the surface?"

---

### 4. LEARN (5-7 min)
*Extract insights and lessons.*

**Prompt Questions**:
- What did I learn about myself?
- What worked well?
- What would I do differently?
- What patterns am I noticing?

**Journaling**:
Write 3-5 key lessons or insights.

**With Companion**:
> "What themes do you notice in what I've shared?"

Companion may offer:
- Patterns across multiple reflections
- Connections you hadn't seen
- Questions to deepen insight

---

### 5. INTEGRATE (3-5 min)
*Decide how to carry this forward.*

**Prompt Questions**:
- What will I do differently tomorrow?
- What do I need to remember?
- What am I releasing?
- What am I embracing?

**Journaling**:
Write 1-3 concrete actions or intentions.

**With Companion**:
> "How can I integrate these insights?"

Companion may suggest:
- Specific practices
- Reminders or rituals
- Ways to embody the learning

---

## Closing

### Gratitude
*Acknowledge the process and yourself.*

**Spoken or Written**:
> "I showed up for myself today.  
> I honored my experience.  
> I learned [key insight].  
> I carry this forward.  
> It is so, because I reflected upon it."

### Save Your Reflection
- [ ] Save journal entry in `sovereign_library/journal/`
- [ ] Tag with date and theme
- [ ] Add to companion's memory vault (optional)

## Variations

### Quick Reflection (5 min)
Use only stages 2, 4, and 5:
- Review: What happened?
- Learn: What did I learn?
- Integrate: What's my next action?

### Deep Reflection (60+ min)
Expand each stage:
- Write longer form
- Multiple companion dialogues
- Create art, poetry, or other expression

### Weekly Ritual
Reflect on the entire week:
- Use all five stages
- Review journal entries from each day
- Look for weekly patterns
- Set intentions for next week

### Crisis Processing
When overwhelmed:
- Skip to Stage 3 (Feel)
- Express emotions fully
- Move to Stage 4 only when ready
- Integration can wait
