# DSDS Rituals

This directory contains ritual templates for structured creative and reflective practices within DSDS.

## What Are Rituals?

Rituals are intentional frameworks for engaging with your creative work, AI companions, and inner wisdom. They provide structure while allowing for spontaneity and flow.

## Available Rituals

### 🔥 Invocation
**Purpose**: Begin creative sessions with intention  
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes  
**Use When**: Starting any DSDS session, especially important work

### 🥁 Drum Circle
**Purpose**: Meditative exploration and processing  
**Duration**: 20-40 minutes  
**Use When**: Need to process emotions, explore ideas, or enter contemplative state

### 🎙️ Podcast Recording
**Purpose**: Structured podcast recording with AI co-host  
**Duration**: 30-90 minutes  
**Use When**: Creating podcast episodes with companion participation

### 📔 Reflection
**Purpose**: Process experiences and extract insights  
**Duration**: 15-60 minutes  
**Use When**: Daily review, weekly reflection, processing events

## Using Rituals

### As Templates
Each ritual is a template. Adapt it to your needs:
- Modify the language
- Adjust the duration
- Add or remove steps
- Combine rituals

### As Inspiration
Don't feel bound by the structure:
- Use what resonates
- Skip what doesn't
- Create your own variations

### As Practice
Rituals gain power through repetition:
- Try a ritual multiple times before judging
- Notice what changes with practice
- Let rituals evolve with you

## Creating Your Own Rituals

Want to create a custom ritual? Consider:

### Structure
1. **Opening**: How do you begin?
2. **Main Practice**: What's the core activity?
3. **Closing**: How do you end?

### Elements
- **Intention**: What's the purpose?
- **Duration**: How long does it take?
- **Materials**: What do you need?
- **Companion Role**: How does AI participate?

### Example: Morning Pages Ritual

```markdown
# Morning Pages Ritual

**Purpose**: Clear mental clutter through writing

## Setup
- Wake up, before checking phone
- Open DSDS or journal
- Set timer for 15 minutes

## Practice
Write three pages (or 15 min) of stream-of-consciousness:
- No editing, no judgment
- Write whatever comes to mind
- If stuck, write "I don't know what to write" until something emerges

## Closing
- Don't read what you wrote (for now)
- Thank yourself for showing up
- Begin your day

*Optional*: Share key theme with AI companion for reflection
```

## Ritual Philosophy

### Sovereignty
You are sovereign over your rituals:
- No "right" way to do them
- Your practice, your rules
- Modify freely

### Intention Over Perfection
The power is in showing up:
- Imperfect practice > no practice
- Intention matters more than execution
- Consistency beats intensity

### AI as Witness
Companions can participate in rituals as:
- **Silent witness**: Present but not speaking
- **Active participant**: Responding and engaging
- **Guide**: Offering prompts and questions
- **Absent**: Some rituals are solo only

**Do I have to use rituals?**
No. They're optional frameworks. Use what serves you.

**Can I modify the rituals?**
Yes. They're templates, not rules. Make them yours.

They can be, or they can be purely practical. You decide the meaning.

As often as they serve you. Could be daily, weekly, or as-needed.

**Can rituals be done without AI?**
Absolutely. All rituals work solo. Companions are optional.
